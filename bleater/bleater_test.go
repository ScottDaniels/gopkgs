/*
	This test is a bit different than most 'go test' function sets as the 
	test verifies that the package can be used, but output from the test
	is vetted by an external script which looks for various things, or the
	absence of things, in the log files that are created. Specifically, 
	the strings looked for in the output are:
		'.*should show.*'			(these are counted)
		'.*should NOT show.*'		(these cause an error if seen)
		'.*baa_some.*:.*'			(last field expected to be a multiple of m in n:m)
		'.*different time format.*'	(time stamp only, no date expected)

	as well as the labels big, little and black.  For the alternate time
	test, the timestamp is expected to present the time first (the date
	is not checked so omitting it, or presenting it second is fine).

	The vetting script also expects two files in /tmp to be created:
		bleat_test.log (containing messages from both little and big sheep)
		bleat_ls_test.log (containing only little sheep messages)

	It is possible for the 'go test' to pass, but for the vetting script to 
	be unhappy with the output and fail the overall test.  The vetting script
	should eliminate the human effort with respect to automating the test.

	create three sheep that bleat.  Big sheep acts as the parent and thus
	the 'master' volume of all children can be controlled by setting the
	level on the big sheep.  The little sheep is given to the big sheep
	as a child, but black-sheep is left on its own. Thus, when the level
	of big-sheep is changed to 2, a bleat by little sheep with a setting
	of 2 should be heard, but when black sheep bleats at 2 it should still
	be silent as it's level has not been increased and it has no parent.

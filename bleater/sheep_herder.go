	Mnemonic:	sheep_herder
	Abstract:	A simple go routine to cause the log file that sheep are writing to to be
				rolled now and again.

	Date:		30 April 2014
	Author:		E. Scott Daniels

	Mods:		16 Jul 2014 - Corrected bug that was causing log file name to be gnerated
					based on local time and not zulu time.
				02 Jul 2014 - Corrected typos in Baa message.

	Generate a new logfile name based on the current date, the log directory passed in
	and the cycle period.

	The file name created will have the syntax:
		<log_dir>/<prefix>.log.<date>

	where <prefix> is taken from the bleater.

	If period is >86400 seconds, then the file name is day based.
	If period is <86400 but > 3600 seconds, then file is based on hour, else
	the file includes the minute and is of the general form yyyymmddhhmm.

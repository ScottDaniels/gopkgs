The ssh_broker requires a fairly new verion of go along with the ssh package. 
Pull the latest with:
	hg clone -u release https://code.google.com/p/go

Or update if you have it.  Go version 1.3.3 or later works fine. You'll also
need to get the crypto package in order to get the ssh support:
	cd $GOPATH
	go get golang.org/x/crypto/ssh
